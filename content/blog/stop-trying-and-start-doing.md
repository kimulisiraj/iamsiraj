# Stop Trying and Start Doing!

"Stop Trying and Start Doing" can’t stop resounding in my mind! As I read from John Maxwell’s book, Intentional Living today, I realized those were not just words or just a motivational phrase that emphasizes the importance of acting and moving forward with one's goals and aspirations. It spoke really loud to me today. “Trying alone does not communicate true commitment. It’s halfhearted. It is not a pledge to do what’s necessary to achieve a goal. It’s another way of saying, “I’ll make an effort.” That’s not many steps away from, “I’ll go through the motions.” Trying rarely achieves anything significant.

Action over intention to emphasize that action speaks louder than words or intentions. Instead of merely thinking about or planning something, it's crucial to take the first step and start working on it.

It encourages individuals to stop hesitating, procrastinating, or doubting themselves and instead, to actively pursue their dreams and ambitions.
This mindset shift is often associated with increased productivity, achievement, and personal growth. Instead of getting stuck in a cycle of endless planning or self-doubt, the idea is to take that first step, no matter how small, toward making things happen.

Remember, every journey begins with a single step, and by acting, you are already making progress toward your goals. So, whether you're pursuing a personal project, a career change, or any other endeavor, embracing this proactive mindset can be a powerful catalyst for success.
