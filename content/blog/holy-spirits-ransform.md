# Holy Spirit’s Transform

The Holy Spirit is like a child, so gentle and loving, always ready to fellowship with me.
I just need to invite Him and He will be with me. However, just like a child that He is that if I grief Him, He withdraws.

The presence of God transforms us and no one that has the Holy Spirit inside of them will act as in the past because He transforms us from inside out and turns us into new beings. He feeds us and fills us with great things that our life begins to radiate the Light of God.

The Holy Spirit is God but sometimes we forget that He is God and tend to ignore Him yet He is our helper, our comforter, the Spirit of God, He is the power of God, He is our God and we should always remember to worship and praise Him at all times too.
