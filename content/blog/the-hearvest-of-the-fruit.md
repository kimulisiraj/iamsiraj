# The Harvest of the Fruit

Usually fruit comes from seed, a seed is planted then slowly by slowly, seconds into minutes, hours into days, weeks into months and into years! The seed is changing and taking form / shape so it can produce and become what it’s meant to become.

It feeds from the nutrients, air, fertilizers, attention, weather conditions it’s given.

If our ears, eyes feed on murder series, abusive words in a movie, watch that gay couple doing the obscene things… we are planting those seeds into our lives, heart and mind and once we see of hear something, we can’t unsee or un-hear them unfortunately.

Sometimes I like to think that when we we listen to anything good, our hearts expand in size and that why we get excited, happy and joyful however when we listen to the bad stuff, it “shrinks” that’s why we get all sad and glumly that we sometimes don’t want to talk to anyone leaving us all alone and by ourselves.

Watch out what and who you listen to because you become what you listen to and watch.

Our ears and eyes are gates and entrances to our souls. The seed we plant will keep expanding and taking form of that which we hear and see and then eventually become a reality in our lives because we start to believe whatever has been created in our minds that we start to speak and declare them until they become our reality.

When you are constantly watching murder series or movies or listening to something related to murder… you start to get ideas for either yourself or people around you… it wasn’t who you were before, you innocently just liked watching these series or movies just to see how the mysteries are solved but the murder seed has been planted in your mind and you can’t shake it off!!

You can plant good seeds too! Listen to Teachings and preachings, read or listen to the word and let the good seed circulate your life so you can get a good harvest.
