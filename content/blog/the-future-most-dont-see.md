# The future most don’t see…
Dear friend, I hope you learn something from this and get a different view on Pastors …

Often times I’m asked if “I’m now a Pastor” by the people who knew me before I got born again and sometimes this question would really piss me off because I really didn’t want to be that “broke person for the rest of my life, the boring person, that person who can’t live a little more or one who doesn’t have a life and is always snooping around in other people’s businesses”… these are some of the ways people describe Pastors.

I’ve been a born-again Christian for 2 years now (time flies really fast) and honestly, I would rather be on this side of the world than the other. It’s really less stressful and complicated than what the world is.
Living the God driven life is far much better than a self-driven life because it’s easier to follow someone from behind than try and create this path and lead yourself all the way so again, I would choose this life again and again…
Can I say it’s a bed of roses? Definitely not but it’s worth it because there’s so much fruit at the end of the planting / sowing season which is the hard part but right after that hurdle, everything else falls in place.

Now if I can get back to the point of this blog, the future that most don’t see is something the Holy Spirit has shown me and why I would need to become a strong pillar in Ministry.
So, the world as we know it keeps evolving not for the better if we are to be honest, more evil keeps cropping up and we keep participating in things like;
1. Homosexuality
2. Pornography
3. Transgender
4. Nudity
5. Terrorism
6. Corruption
7. High rate of Divorce
8. Murder
9. Rape
10. Alcoholism
11. Drug addiction

The list is endless! All these things and many others that have been left out is as a result of not being taught the Gospel, The Very Good News, our Creator’s Word! There are people teaching the Word of God and people keep trashing it and even think it’s no longer “cool” to go to church. Some have taken it a step further and claim there’s no God! Such stupidity!

To the parents out there, just because you’re still alive right and you are trying the best way you know to keep your kids (older / younger) from these things is not a guarantee that they will be protected from the same when you’re gone.

Think about it for a minute, when you’re gone and can’t physically protect them and the world now can do to them whatever it is that it wants and your little baby girl is raped or decides that she now likes girls instead of boys or decides to go around selling her body to men for status, money, position, name it… would you be thrilled that this would be happening to her? It’s the world you decided you try and escape from that has given not you but your kids a taste of what you would have changed! It’s from deciding that you want to be a world changer for the better that these things get eradicated out of this world. The filth needs to be cleaned out and replaced with God’s word and acting on it. So, teach the young people to pray to guide them and protect them from the evil, let them practice these things so it can be their anchor while you’re gone. It won’t be the case of homosexuality because from the Bible they would know God hates it so much, teach them how to be and stay happily married, teach them ways in which to make money so they are not selling off your hard-earned assets for bread.

Parents, wake up and let’s hit the point(s) head on while we still have the chance to.
