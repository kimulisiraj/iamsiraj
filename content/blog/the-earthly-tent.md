# The earthly Tent

As I continue to live on earth and read the Word of God - The Bible, there’s so much revelation but also just from seeing how life is here in earth is, only one can tell that we are just visiting the earth.

The bodies we were clothed with are our gifts from God. I can’t imagine being born without my earthly tent!!! My parents did such a great job taking care of me while I was a baby to my teenage life. It was washed, fed, treated and nourished in so many different ways. My heart’s full and super grateful.

As things are passed down from generation to generation, I was handed over the responsibility to nourish my tent from thereafter.
Just trying to think through at how I have lived my life here on earth, tortured, tormented, beaten but yet also loved, pampered and nourished it while in my younger days.

As I get wiser, I now know what to do with my precious tent, how to treat it in order to stay longer because I’m now working with God’s word for it says in Psalms 91:16, with long life I shall satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

As I take care, I wait on the Lord to continue showing me His Salvation.

My question to you today is, how are you handling your body? Are you handling it with at most care and love or are you doing things to it, torturing and tormenting it?!

You only have one life, one body (if you choose to think right) and plenty of chances to change your story (though they too run out)

Love. Smile. Enjoy wisely.
