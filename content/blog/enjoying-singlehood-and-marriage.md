# Enjoying Singlehood and Marriage

As I get wider, I get to deeply understand the phrase “enjoy every stage of your life.” I am diving into a subject that’s hot and sensitive but hey, let’s talk! You will hear this from the marrieds encouraging the single not to rush into getting married because think about it, you have the rest of your life to be with this one person and also an opportunity to learn, grow and discover your true self while single. Both singlehood and marriage have their own unique joys and opportunities and it's important for individuals to appreciate and make the most of each stage in their life without feeling pressured to rush through them.

### As we take a car and journey through singlehood, here are some of the lanes one could take …
1. Independence: Being single often provides a high degree of independence where one is fully responsible for their decisions, plans and choices.
2.	Self-discovery: Singlehood can be a time for self-discovery and personal growth. It allows individuals to explore their interests, passions, and goals.
3.	Social connections: You can invest more time in building diverse social connections and nurturing existing friendships. It's a time for expanding your social circle.
4.	Career and personal development: Without the responsibilities of a relationship, you may have more time and energy to focus on your career and personal development.
5.	Dating and exploration: For those interested in romantic relationships, singlehood offers the opportunity to date and explore different types of relationships.

### Marriage:
1.	Companionship: Marriage often brings a deep sense of companionship and emotional support. Sharing life with a partner can be incredibly rewarding.
2.	Family building: Many couples choose to start families after getting married, which opens up a new chapter of life with the joys and challenges of parenthood.
3.	Stability: Marriage can provide a sense of stability and security, both emotionally and financially.
4.	Shared goals: Couples in a marriage often work together to set and achieve shared goals, which can be fulfilling.
5.	Long-term commitment: Marriage is a commitment to stand by each other's side through thick and thin, which can be a beautiful and enduring aspect of life.

It's important for individuals to enjoy and embrace their current stage of life, whether they're single or married, and not rush into a different stage solely because of societal expectations or pressures. The key is to make the most of each stage and find happiness and fulfillment in it, while also being open to change and growth when the time is right. Ultimately, the "right" stage of life is a highly individual choice and can vary from person to person.
