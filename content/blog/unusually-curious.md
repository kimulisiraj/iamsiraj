Have you ever been curious about something or someone and you thought it / they were bad or just had no opinion about them but wanted to find out more?

I have had my share of curiosity marks and most were really not good; ended up doing the wrong stuff, being with the wrong people that eventually led to the worst decisions I ever made.

However, there were the good curiosity marks too and I loved me more for taking the extra step to get to do something or get to know someone more… had greater opportunities flood my way, met really amazing people, enjoyed amazing places too! At that point, those were the best moments of my life!

As I read Exodus Chapter 3 verse 2 - 4, I couldn’t help but imagine what I would if I were Moses having seen the burning bush that wasn’t actually burning!

Being me, I would walk straight past it and carry my curiosity all the way to the other end.

I would have then missed the opportunity to talk with God (being Moses) … o would have missed the grand opportunity of my life!

“There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from the middle of a bush. Moses stared in amazement. Though the bush was engulfed in flames, it didn’t burn up. “This is amazing,” Moses said to himself. “Why isn’t that bush burning up? I must go see it.” When the Lord saw Moses coming to take a closer look, God called to him from the middle of the bush, “Moses! Moses!” “Here I am!” Moses replied.”

Are there things, people or places that have been usual and you have not given it much thought or paid any closer attention to? Have you wondered why it’s that way?

The little voice in your head telling you to do otherwise from what you know (you need to discern the better and wiser option) … do we pay attention to it or quickly brush it off just because it’s unusual.

If Moses hadn’t gone a little closer to the mysterious burning bush, the history we know now wouldn’t exist!

Not all the unusual are bad…
