# Staying Woke…
When I speak, I let and when I let, I then see. There are things I will say that will be good and there will be things that I say (let out but they won’t be good) 

“And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.”
Genesis 1:4 NKJV

It’s in my power to use wisdom and knowledge to separate between good and bad. I shouldn’t take in everything or leave out everything. Just use wisdom to discern.

“So, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.”
Genesis 3:6 NKJV

We are being handed over things from the lying serpent, the devil himself, twisting things every single time but the beauty about this all is we have a deep well of truth - The Bible. It’s God’s precious “True Sayings” about us to us, we don’t have to be deceived anymore by the devil.
The honest truth is that we all know what is right and wrong deep down inside of us.
It’s what we took away from the Garden of Eden.

To date, we are being handed to things from the devil and we are constantly making a choice. There are only 2 choices to choose from, I hope we are constantly choosing the right one!

You may say that you don’t know which the right one is only after you have made the decision but you really don’t have to wait for the outcome of your decision, just turn to the Bible and seek what God says about that thing, ask Him in prayer …

“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”
Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV

Human beings are limited to some extent, we don’t know everything but there’s one that knows it All, why not seek advice from Him constantly rather than continuously make those wrong decisions and then end up regretting and hating ourselves for something we could have avoided. 

Let’s stop running away from the One that wants us to prosper, make it in life, succeed, be the Best versions of ourselves…. His Name is Jesus and He is calling us to the better side of Life.
