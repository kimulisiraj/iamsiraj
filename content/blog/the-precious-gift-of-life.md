What’s the most important gift you have ever received from someone or given to someone?!

I know these will range from free fully paid trips, fragrances, a month’s rent, clothes, shoes, money, name it…. All these are nice and cute, however, Precious? I’m not sure they fit the description to the maximum.

At some point in my life, I was unable to walk, eat, drink or poop because of a small pocket of fluid in my body in the wrong place. I couldn’t imagine how the latter was so important up until that day.
When I was much younger, I survived on inhales just so I could keep alive. I think I’ve stared at death a few times but Phewww we bless the Living God who is faithful and wouldn’t let me kick the bucket just before my time was up!

Never ending darkness is all my imagination can put together to refer the death. It’s something we choose to ignore but knowing very well we can’t escape it. Yes, we choose to have it at the back of our minds, however from the moment we get to planet earth as babies, everything we do is planned with the end in mind.

….sips tea…

So while that there’s, there’s this middle gap that we can now the only thing left to do is enjoy (wisely) the Precious Gift - Life!
