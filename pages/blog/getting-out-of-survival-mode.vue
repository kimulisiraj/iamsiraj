          People are living their lives reactively. They wake up and immediately check their smartphone. They feel RUSHED and BUSY immediately upon waking up.
          Their whole day and life reflect how they wake up. Consequently, their health and relationships suffer.
          Moreover, their overall happiness and well-being are lacking, as they are not living according to their highest values and goals.
        </p>
        <p class="font-italic text-xl font-bold">
          The purpose of the MORNING ROUTINE is to GET YOU OUT OF SURVIVAL MODE.
        </p>

        <p>
          You do that by giving yourself space in the morning to orient yourself with the person you intend to be. You also orient yourself toward your highest goals and priorities.
          If you have a consistent morning routine, your life will be very different in 3-6 months. No longer will you be RUSHED and REACTIVE. Instead, you'll be living with INTENTION and PURPOSE.
        </p>

        <p>To stay focused and pro-active, I have developed a series of morning routines the will help you get the best of your self in this season.</p>

        <h3>How This Checklist Works</h3>

        <p>
          Obviously, you don't need to do all of the things on the list. Think of this checklist as a buffet from which you can select the ones that work for you, and there are likely several things you may try that aren't on this list.
          Also, your morning routine will likely change over time, depending on the various seasons of your life. For example, sometimes, I'm highly focused on writing, and thus my morning routine is directed toward focused work. In other seasons, I spend more time in the mornings with learning new skills as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>No matter which season of life I'm in, a few things remain constant:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Prayer/meditation</li>
          <li> Cold showers</li>
          <li> Journal writing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparing for Bed.</h3>
        <ul>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 5 minutes before you go to bed mapping your top 1-3 priorities for the next day</span></ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 10 minutes before bed thinking about your number 1 goal or number 1 problem you're trying to solve;</span> this will prime your subconscious while you sleep. As Thomas Edison has said, "Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious."</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Don't check email/social media within 40 minutes of going to bed</span> (this is unplugged time to be present with family and to rest/recover from the day)</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Have an alarm set across your room,</span> so you have to get out of bed to quiet the alarm (if you fight waking up in the morning)</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 5-10 minutes in prayer;</span> talk to God, Focus on gratitude, your goals, and where you are most needed today. This will set your day's trajectory on the things that really matter. It will also provide you with an abundance mindset where you expect good things to happen for you.</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Pull out your journal and write by hand anything that comes to your mind related to your #1 goal or #1 problem you're trying to solve.</span> This will arouse the subconscious breakthroughs you had while you were asleep. As Napoleon Hill has said, "Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you sleep." During your journal session, write your big picture vision/goals down in bullet point form and in present-tense (e.g., I'm the most excellent software engineer, I'm making over $250,000/year, I'm fully connected and present with my family and fianc√©, etc.).</ol>
        </ul>

        <h3>The perfect evening routine.</h3>
        <ul>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 5- 15 minutes in Prayer/meditation</span></ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 7-15 minutes in intensive physical fitness</span></ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Spend 15-60 minutes in focused activity on a big picture goal or passion project</span> (one of those things you've been procrastinating but want to do)</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Don't check email or social media for at least 60 minutes after waking up.</span> When I do so, the events in the emails and social, tend to influence how I drive my day, so I attend to social medial after focusing on the morning big goal of the day.</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">Take a cold shower. </span> If this shower is immediately following physical fitness, just start with a cold. If it is not, start warm.</ol>
          <ol>
            <span class="font-semibold">Listen to or read uplifting content </span>(you can do this while you exercise if that's convenient). This will get you motivated and energized to tackle the day. A few recommendations:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="">The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Essentialism by Greg McKeown</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert</a></li>
              <li><a href="">As a Man Thinketh by James Allen</a></li>
              <li><a href="">Relentless by Tim Grover</a></li>
              <li><a href="">The Power of Starting Something Stupid by Richie Norton</a></li>
              <li><a href="">The Power of Intention by Wayne Dyer</a></li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">After you've spent a few minutes purposefully preparing yourself for HOW YOU INTEND TO BE that day,</span> lovingly interact with your loved ones. If you live alone, send a few kind texts to important people in your life</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">If you have kids, play with them for as much time as you can. Be sure to take a few minutes before interacting with them to orient yourself.</span> Don't reactively wake up and then be with them. You won't be on your A-Game.</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">If you have creative endeavours, spend 60-90 minutes in focused activity on a big project.</span> Research has found that your willpower is highest when your first wake up, and your brain is most attuned to creativity. Thus, if you make the time, the morning may be the time when you produce your best and most important work, as is the case for me!</ol>
          <ol><span class="font-semibold">If you're doing creative "Deep Work" immediately upon waking up, try listening to instrumental/ambient songs on repeat.</span> In her book, On Repeat: How Music Plays the Mind, psychologist Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis explains why listening to music on repeat improves focus. When you're listening to a song on repeat, you tend to dissolve into the song, which blocks out mind wandering (let your mind wander while you're away from work!).</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>That's what I have for today, feel free to alter it and make it yours.</p>
